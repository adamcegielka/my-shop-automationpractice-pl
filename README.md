# :shopping_cart: My Shop - automationpractice.pl

The aim of this project is to create tests in [TestRail](https://www.testrail.com/), report errors in [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/pl/software/jira/) and create automated tests in [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for the [automationpractice.pl](http://www.automationpractice.pl/) application. The project aims to gain valuable experience in testing.

## Project scope

- Designing test cases in TestRail and creating a report.
- Execution of manual tests based on the designed test cases.
- Bug reporting in JIRA.
- Writing and running automated tests in Playwright.
- Executing tests in different browsers (chromium, firefox, webkit).
- Testing of various types including E2E, Functional, Compatibility, Responsiveness, Navigation and Usability.

## Work environment:
- Windows 10 Home
- Browser:
  - Chrome
  - Firefox Developer Edition
  - Opera
- Playwright
  - Browsers: chromium, firefox, webkit

## Documentation

The entire testing process will be [documented](https://github.com/adamcegielka/my-shop-automationpractice-pl/tree/main/docs/progress-and-test-results), from the designed [test cases](https://github.com/adamcegielka/my-shop-automationpractice-pl/tree/main/test-cases) to the test results to the reported [bugs](https://github.com/adamcegielka/my-shop-automationpractice-pl/tree/main/bugs). This will enable a fuller understanding of the activities carried out and facilitate possible future reference.  
In addition, [tips](https://github.com/adamcegielka/my-shop-automationpractice-pl/tree/main/tips) will be collected so that they can be used for improvement in future tests. 

## Summary

This `My Shop - automationpractice.pl` project aims to ensure high-quality application testing, gain valuable testing experience and improve the testing process through automation. I will use a variety of tools and technologies to achieve my project goals. Once the testing is complete, I will carefully analyze the results so as not to make the same mistakes of mistakes in the future. Through this work, I can also expand my knowledge of testing and improve my skills. I believe that this project will benefit both me and those starting out in testing.
