## Progress and test results

### Date - 2023-08-04

- Carrying out manual tests from `009-TC` to `016-TC` from section `02 Registration form` using browsers:
    - Chromium
    - Firefox Developer Edition
    - Opera
- Writing the automatic tests from `009-TC` to `016-TC` from section `02 Registration form`
- Refactoring the automated tests with POM
- Updating data in the `registration.page.ts` and `registration.data.ts` files
- Creation of file `tsconfig.json`

### Test result reports

- All tests successfully completed.

### Problems and errors

1.  When running the `012-TC` test, there was a problem entering the password which caused a bad assertion and the test failed.

### Solution

1. I added a delay to the `012-TC` test before filling in the password field `page.waitForTimeout(1000);` which gave the application a little more time to load the page.
With the inputs for `First Name` and `Last Name` there was no such problem.
